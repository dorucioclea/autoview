      "description": "Section information.\n\n`IShoppingSection` is a concept that refers to the spatial information of\nthe market.\n\nIf we compare the section mentioned here to the offline market, it means a\nspatially separated area within the store, such as the \"fruit corner\" or\n\"butcher corner\". Therefore, in the {@link IShoppingSale sale} entity, it is\nnot possible to classify multiple sections simultaneously, but only one section\ncan be classified.\n\nBy the way, if your shopping mall system requires only one section, then just\nuse only one. This concept is designed to be expandable in the future.",
