     * `IShoppingCoupon` is an entity that symbolizes discount coupons at
     * a shopping mall.
     *
     * Note that, `IShoppingCoupon` only contains specification information
     * about discount coupons. Please keep in mind that this is a different
     * concept from {@link IShoppingCouponTicket}, which refers to the issuance
     * of a discount coupon, or {@link IShoppingCouponTicketPayment}, which
     * refers to its payment.
     *
     * Additionally, discount coupons are applied on an order-by-order basis,
     * but each has its own unique restrictions. For example, a coupon with
     * {@link IShoppingCouponSellerCriteria} may or may not be used only for
     * {@link IShoppingSale} of listings registered by the {@link IShoppingSeller}.
     * Also, there are restrictions such as
     * {@link IShoppingCouponDiscount.threshold minimum amount restrictions} for
     * using discount coupons and
     * {@link IShoppingCouponDiscount.limit maximum discount amount limits}.
     *
     * In addition, you can set whether to issue discount coupons publicly or
     * give them only to people who know the specific issuing code. In addition,
     * there are restrictions such as issued discount coupons having an
     * {@link IShoppingCouponRestriction.expired_at expiration date} or being
     * issued only to customers who came in through a
     * {@link IShoppingCouponFunnelCriteria specific funnel}.
