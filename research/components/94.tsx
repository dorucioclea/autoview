     * a person performs at the shopping mall in various ways like below.
     *
     * - Same person comes from an {@link IShoppingExternalUser external service}
     * - Same person creates multiple accounts
     * - Same person makes a {@link IShoppingOrderPublish purchase} as a non-member with only {@link IShoppingCitizen real name authentication}
     * - Same person acts both {@link IShoppingSeller seller} and {@link IShoppingAdministrator admin} at the same time
     *
     * Therefore, `IShoppingCustomer` can have multiple records with the same
     * {@link IShoppingCitizen}, {@link IShoppingMember}, and
     * {@link IShoppingExternalUser}. Additionally, if a customer signs up for
     * membership after verifying their real name or signs up for our service after
     * being a user of an external service, all related records are changed at once.
