  /**
   * Discount coupon.
   *
   * `IShoppingCoupon` is an entity that symbolizes discount coupons at
   * a shopping mall.
   *
   * Note that, `IShoppingCoupon` only contains specification information
   * about discount coupons. Please keep in mind that this is a different
   * concept from {@link IShoppingCouponTicket}, which refers to the issuance
   * of a discount coupon, or {@link IShoppingCouponTicketPayment}, which
   * refers to its payment.
   *
   * Additionally, discount coupons are applied on an order-by-order basis,
   * but each has its own unique restrictions. For example, a coupon with
   * {@link IShoppingCouponSellerCriteria} may or may not be used only for
   * {@link IShoppingSale} of listings registered by the {@link IShoppingSeller}.
   * Also, there are restrictions such as
   * {@link IShoppingCouponDiscount.threshold minimum amount restrictions} for
   * using discount coupons and
   * {@link IShoppingCouponDiscount.limit maximum discount amount limits}.
   *
   * In addition, you can set whether to issue discount coupons publicly or
   * give them only to people who know the specific issuing code. In addition,
   * there are restrictions such as issued discount coupons having an
   * {@link IShoppingCouponRestriction.expired_at expiration date} or being
   * issued only to customers who came in through a
   * {@link IShoppingCouponFunnelCriteria specific funnel}.
   *
   * For more information, please refer to the properties below and the
   * subsidiary entities described later.
