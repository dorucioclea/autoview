   * Customer information, but not a person but a connection basis.
   *
   * `IShoppingCustomer` is an entity that literally embodies the information of
   * those who participated in the market as customers. By the way, the
   * `IShoppingCustomer` does not mean a person, but a connection basis. Therefore,
   * even if the same person connects to the shopping mall multiple, multiple
   * records are created in `IShoppingCustomer`.
   *
   * The first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,
   * and it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member,
   * {@link IShoppingCartCommodity puts items in the shopping cart} in advance,
   * and only authenticates their {@link IShoppingCitizen real name} or
   * registers/logs in at the moment of {@link IShoppingOrderPublish payment}.
   * It is the second. Lastly, it is to accurately track the activities that
   * a person performs at the shopping mall in various ways like below.
   *
   * - Same person comes from an {@link IShoppingExternalUser external service}
   * - Same person creates multiple accounts
   * - Same person makes a {@link IShoppingOrderPublish purchase} as a non-member with only {@link IShoppingCitizen real name authentication}
   * - Same person acts both {@link IShoppingSeller seller} and {@link IShoppingAdministrator admin} at the same time
   *
   * Therefore, `IShoppingCustomer` can have multiple records with the same
   * {@link IShoppingCitizen}, {@link IShoppingMember}, and
   * {@link IShoppingExternalUser}. Additionally, if a customer signs up for
   * membership after verifying their real name or signs up for our service after
   * being a user of an external service, all related records are changed at once.
   * Therefore, identification and tracking of customers can be done very
   * systematically.
