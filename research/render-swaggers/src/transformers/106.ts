     * > "product sales" (sales) information registered by the
     * > {@link IShoppingSeller seller}. And the main information of the sale is

     * > {@link IShoppingSale shopping_sales}. When a seller changes a previously
     * > registered item, the existing {@link IShoppingSale shopping_sales} record
     * > is not changed, but a new snapshot record is created.
     * >
     * > This is to preserve the {@link IShoppingCustomer customer}'s
     * > {@link IShoppingOrder purchase history} flawlessly after the customer
     * > purchases a specific item, even if the seller changes the components or price
     * > of the item. It is also intended to support sellers in so-called A/B testing,
     * > which involves changing components or prices and measuring the performance
     * > in each case.

     * But even though the DTO level does not strictly distinguish them, the word and
     * concept of "snapshot" is still important, so it is recommended to understand
     * the concept of "snapshot" properly.
