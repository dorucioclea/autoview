     * `IShoppingSection` is a concept that refers to the spatial information of
     * the market.
     *
     * If we compare the section mentioned here to the offline market, it means a
     * spatially separated area within the store, such as the "fruit corner" or
     * "butcher corner". Therefore, in the {@link IShoppingSale sale} entity, it is
     * not possible to classify multiple sections simultaneously, but only one section
     * can be classified.
     *
     * By the way, if your shopping mall system requires only one section, then just
     * use only one. This concept is designed to be expandable in the future.
