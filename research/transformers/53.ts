     * Customer information, but not a person but a connection basis.
     *
     * `IShoppingCustomer` is an entity that literally embodies the information of
     * those who participated in the market as customers. By the way, the
     * `IShoppingCustomer` does not mean a person, but a connection basis. Therefore,
     * even if the same person connects to the shopping mall multiple, multiple
     * records are created in `IShoppingCustomer`.
     *
     * The first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,
     * and it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member,
     * {@link IShoppingCartCommodity puts items in the shopping cart} in advance,
     * and only authenticates their {@link IShoppingCitizen real name} or
     * registers/logs in at the moment of {@link IShoppingOrderPublish payment}.
     * It is the second. Lastly, it is to accurately track the activities that
     * a person performs at the shopping mall in various ways like below.
     *
     * - Same person comes from an {@link IShoppingExternalUser external service}
     * - Same person creates multiple accounts
     * - Same person makes a {@link IShoppingOrderPublish purchase} as a non-member with only {@link IShoppingCitizen real name authentication}
     * - Same person acts both {@link IShoppingSeller seller} and {@link IShoppingAdministrator admin} at the same time
     *
     * Therefore, `IShoppingCustomer` can have multiple records with the same
     * {@link IShoppingCitizen}, {@link IShoppingMember}, and
     * {@link IShoppingExternalUser}. Additionally, if a customer signs up for
     * membership after verifying their real name or signs up for our service after
     * being a user of an external service, all related records are changed at once.
     * Therefore, identification and tracking of customers can be done very
     * systematically.
