/**
 * Customer information, but not a person but a connection basis.
 *
 * `IShoppingCustomer` is an entity that literally embodies the information of
 * those who participated in the market as customers. By the way, the
 * `IShoppingCustomer` does not mean a person, but a connection basis. Therefore,
 * even if the same person connects to the shopping mall multiple, multiple
 * records are created in `IShoppingCustomer`.
 *
 * The first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,
 * and it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member,
 * {@link IShoppingCartCommodity puts items in the shopping cart} in advance,
 * and only authenticates their {@link IShoppingCitizen real name} or
 * registers/logs in at the moment of {@link IShoppingOrderPublish payment}.
 * It is the second. Lastly, it is to accurately track the activities that
 * a person performs at the shopping mall in various ways like below.
 *
 * - Same person comes from an {@link IShoppingExternalUser external service}
 * - Same person creates multiple accounts
 * - Same person makes a {@link IShoppingOrderPublish purchase} as a non-member with only {@link IShoppingCitizen real name authentication}
 * - Same person acts both {@link IShoppingSeller seller} and {@link IShoppingAdministrator admin} at the same time
 *
 * Therefore, `IShoppingCustomer` can have multiple records with the same
 * {@link IShoppingCitizen}, {@link IShoppingMember}, and
 * {@link IShoppingExternalUser}. Additionally, if a customer signs up for
 * membership after verifying their real name or signs up for our service after
 * being a user of an external service, all related records are changed at once.
 * Therefore, identification and tracking of customers can be done very
 * systematically.
